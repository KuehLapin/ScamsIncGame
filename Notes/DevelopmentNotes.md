Development Notes: Currently recording notes detailing my process in this README file.

1. Originally made this game on Twine but thought it would go quicker if I use a method I'm already familiar with, so I am transferring it over into a website format. Hoping this will make it easier to customise the game. Main issues I encountered when using Twine was it frequently crashed on my computer, which slowed the creation process cosniderably. This occurred especially when trying to import and insert images. However, Twine was still useful in creating a story map, to visualise the routes and dialogue choices. Will refer to it when creating this new website version.
